## Installing MySQL Server
### Installing MySQL Server

1. **Download and Run the Installer:**
   - Visit the [MySQL official website](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/installer/) and download the appropriate version for your operating system.
   - Launch the installer and choose the "Server only" or "Full" setup type, depending on your needs.
   - Proceed through the installation wizard, where you will reach the **"MySQL Server Configuration"** step.

2. **Configure Root Password:**
   - In the **"Accounts and Roles"** section, you’ll be prompted to set a root user password, which is essential as the root user has full administrative control over the MySQL server.
   - Enter your desired password and, optionally, create additional user accounts with different access levels.

3. **Complete Installation and Verify:**
   - Finish the installation process, ensuring all settings, including the root password, are applied.
   - To verify the installation, open a command prompt or terminal and type:
     ```bash
     mysql -u root -p
     ```
   - Enter the root password you defined during installation. If successful, you’ll be logged into the MySQL shell, confirming that MySQL is properly installed and accessible.

>[!WARNING]
> In some situations, if your path is not defined, you might want to specify the full path to the mysql executable. For example, in windows, we will write something like: ```C:\Path\to\MySQLserver\bin\mysql -u user -p password```. Replace with your path.

## Sakila Database
You can find the files required to install the sakila database in the sql/sakila-db folder in the repository

There are several ways you can install this database.

Pre-requisites:
*  MySQL Workbench installed.
*  MySQL server running.

### Using the Terminal

Using the terminal, go to the folder where the database files are located (to make it easier for you)

Connect to the MySQL server using the mysql command-line client with the following command:

```$> mysql -u root -p```

Enter your password when prompted. A non-root account can be used, provided that the account has privileges to create new databases.

Execute the sakila-schema.sql script to create the database structure, and execute the sakila-data.sql script to populate the database structure, by using the following commands:

```sql
mysql> SOURCE sakila-schema.sql;
mysql> SOURCE sakila-data.sql;
```

if you decide not to go to the folder where the files are located

```sql
mysql> SOURCE C:/temp/sakila-db/sakila-schema.sql;
mysql> SOURCE C:/temp/sakila-db/sakila-data.sql;
```
Replace the paths to the sakila-schema.sql and sakila-data.sql files with the actual paths on your system.

Check that you can actually use the database

```sql
mysql> USE sakila;
Database changed
```

```
mysql> SHOW FULL TABLES;
```

Test that you can query the data
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM film;
```

### Using MySQL workbench

**Installing the Sakila Database**

### Understanding the Sakila Database
The Sakila database is a sample database provided by MySQL for learning and testing purposes. It contains information about a fictional video rental store.

### Downloading the Sakila Database
**If you've already downloaded the Sakila database files from our class repository, you can skip the following instructions. Otherwise, please follow these steps for reference.**

1. **Visit the MySQL Developer Zone:** [https://dev.mysql.com/doc/index-other.html](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/index-other.html)
2. Download the Sakila database archive. It usually comes in a compressed format (e.g., .tar.gz or .zip).

### Installing via Terminal
**Prerequisites:**
* MySQL server installed and running.
* Basic understanding of terminal commands.

**Steps:**
1. **Extract the archive:** Use appropriate commands for your operating system (e.g., `tar -zxvf sakila.tar.gz` for Linux/macOS, `unzip sakila.zip` for Windows).
2. **Open a terminal:** Navigate to the extracted directory containing `sakila-schema.sql` and `sakila-data.sql` files.
3. **Create the Sakila database:**
   ```bash
   mysql -u your_username -p
   CREATE DATABASE sakila;
   USE sakila;
   ```
   Replace `your_username` with your MySQL username and provide the password when prompted.
4. **Import schema:**
   ```bash
   mysql -u your_username -p sakila < sakila-schema.sql
   ```
5. **Import data:**
   ```bash
   mysql -u your_username -p sakila < sakila-data.sql
   ```

### Installing via MySQL Workbench


**Steps:**
1. **Open MySQL Workbench:** Create a new connection to your MySQL server.
2. **Create the Sakila database:** Right-click on the connections tab, select "Create Schema", and name it "sakila".
3. **Import schema:**
   * Open the SQL editor.
   * Click the "Open SQL Script" button.
   * Select the `sakila-schema.sql` file.
   * Execute the script.
4. **Import data:**
   * Repeat the process for the `sakila-data.sql` file.
