## Connecting to and Exploring the Sakila Database
Once you have installed the Sakila database, you can either access the database through the terminal or MySQL workbench.

To access it through the terminal:

```sql
$ mysql -u root -p
```

you will prompted for your password

>[!WARNING]
> In some situations, if your path is not defined, you might want to specify the full path to the mysql executable. For example, in windows, we will write something like: ```C:\Path\to\MySQLserver\bin\mysql -u user -p password```. Replace with your path.

Once you have accessed mysql, you can check what databases you have with:

```sql
$ mysql> SHOW databases;
```

Let's use sakila

```sql
$ mysql> USE sakila
```

and we can a look at the different tables available

```sql
$ mysql> SHOW tables;
```
