1.  Cartesian Product Generation

    A CROSS JOIN produces a Cartesian product of the two tables involved. This means it combines each row from the first table with every row from the second table. For example, if Table A has 1,000 rows and Table B has 1,000 rows, a CROSS JOIN will produce 1,000,000 rows (1,000 x 1,000).

2.  Resource Intensive

    Generating this Cartesian product is extremely resource-intensive. It requires a lot of CPU processing power and memory to create this large intermediate result set.

3.  Filtering After Join

    When you use a WHERE clause after a CROSS JOIN to simulate an INNER JOIN, you're essentially asking the database to:
    a. Generate all possible combinations of rows (Cartesian product)
    b. Then filter out the rows that don't meet the join condition
    This two-step process is much less efficient than an INNER JOIN, which only combines the rows that match the join condition in the first place.

4.  Query Optimizer Limitations

    While modern database query optimizers are sophisticated, they may not always be able to optimize a CROSS JOIN with a WHERE clause as effectively as an explicit INNER JOIN. The intent of the query is less clear, which can lead to suboptimal execution plans.

5.  Scalability Issues

    As your data grows, the performance difference between a proper INNER JOIN and a CROSS JOIN used as an INNER JOIN will become more pronounced. The Cartesian product grows exponentially, making this approach increasingly inefficient with larger datasets.

6.  Index Usage

    An INNER JOIN can often make better use of indexes on the join columns. A CROSS JOIN followed by a WHERE clause may not utilize indexes as effectively, potentially leading to full table scans.
